Experiment B1
Equal
Because static type does not effect the counter. And it need return static type variable, otherwise, the data will be destroyed.

Experiment B2 
Slow
Because the counter of copy constructor is call 3 times, it is 2 times more than the original.

When return temp, it will call the destructor and create an object to save the returned things. It will call copy constructor to do this. So, it will add 2 to the counter of copy constructor.
