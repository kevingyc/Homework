Set variables n1,n2,gcd

Input the two numbers,store in n1 and n2
 

If the two numbers are both not be equal to zero
	Run the while loop

		While the remainder(store in n1 and n2) is not be equal to zero

			If n1 is bigger than n2
				n1 divide by n2, take the remainder
				Store the remainder into n1
			Else 			
				n2 divide by n1, take the remainder
				Store the remainder into n2
		
	Adding n1 to n2,store in gcd
	Print the GCD

Else
	Print the error messenger
